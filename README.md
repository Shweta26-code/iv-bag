content of iv bag monitoring system in github readme
Here's an example of what the content of a README file for an IV bag monitoring system might look like:

IV Bag Monitoring System
Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for an IoT-Based Automated IV Bag Monitoring System designed to enhance patient care by automating IV fluid monitoring and providing real-time alerts for critical conditions.

Features
Real-Time IV Bag Monitoring: Continuously measures the IV bag weight using an HX711 load cell.

Room Environment Monitoring: Tracks temperature and humidity using a DHT11 sensor.

Automated IV Tube Control: Employs a servo motor to stop IV fluid flow when the bag is empty.

Visual and Audio Alerts: Provides alerts using LEDs and a buzzer for critical conditions.
IoT Integration: Sends real-time notifications to caregivers via the Blynk IoT platform.

Threshold Alerts: Weight thresholds: Normal, Almost Empty, Empty. Temperature thresholds: High (>32°C) and Low (<16°C).

Hardware Requirements
Microcontroller: NodeMCU ESP8266

Sensors: HX711 Load Cell (weight measurement), DHT11 (temperature and humidity measurement)

Actuators: Servo motor (automated IV tube control), Buzzer (audio alerts), LEDs (visual alerts: Green, Yellow, Red)

Power Supply: 3.3V/5V power source

Additional Components: Breadboard and jumper wires, Resistors (for LEDs)

Software Requirements
Arduino IDE: For writing and uploading the code.

Blynk IoT Platform: For real-time notifications and remote monitoring.

Libraries: Servo.h, DHT.h, HX711.h, BlynkSimpleEsp8266.h

Installation Steps
Hardware Setup: Connect the sensors and actuators to the NodeMCU ESP8266 as per the pin connections table.

Power the NodeMCU: Use a suitable power supply.

Software Setup: Install the required libraries in the Arduino IDE.

Upload Code: Open the provided Arduino sketch and update the credentials (WiFi SSID, password, Blynk Auth Token).

Blynk Configuration: Set up a Blynk template with Virtual Pins for temperature, humidity, and weight.

Usage: Power on the system, calibrate the load cell, place the IV bag on the load cell, and monitor the IV bag weight and room conditions in real-time via the Blynk dashboard.
